# Deep_Neural_Networks_MNIST_Dataset

Deep learning algorithm created based on MNIST dataset - handwritten digit recognition (created by Yan LeCun).
The data provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). 
The goal was to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits, this is a classification problem with 10 classes. 
Neural network with two hidden layers was applied.

This model was created based on one of exercise from "The Data Science Course 2020" course. 
Course made by 365 Careers published on Udemy platform. This course gives the outlook for the very wide subject as Data Science. 
This training covers topics like: mathematics, statistics, Python, applying advanced statistical techniques in Python, data visualization , Machine Learning , Deep Learning.
